		<text>So, this time you won and became the Champion of the Arena, but this is simply passing title and it does not guarantee that the next tournament will you play in the box. Tournaments are held more or less regularly - once or twice a day, fighting from 22:00 to 06:00, the opening of the Arena will know of the messages that I will transmit a common channel. Until you're the champion you have full access by selecting all the announced fights - this means only you decide with whom, what, and in what order to fight. Only here about the weapons there are a few restrictions - you cannot use any explosive charges and grenades, heavy weapons, RG-6, RPG-7 and a Gauss gun. That is all, now Arena needs a little clean up, so while you can go to a bar and get drunk, just don't miss the opening, see you soon.</text>
